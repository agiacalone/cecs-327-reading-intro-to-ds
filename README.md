# CECS 327 Reading Assignment: Introduction to Distributed Systems

### Assignment Description
Answer the following questions from the Chapter 1 reading from your textbook. Be complete with your answers. You may work on these questions with one or two other partners, but *all* students must submit the document individually in their own repositories along with each student's name documented with the submission.

1. Name two advantages and two disadvantages of distributed systems over centralized systems.
2. Describe what is meant by a scalable system.
3. Executing nested transactions requires some form of coordination. Explain what a coordinator should be doing in a scenario like this.
4. What is the role of middleware in a distributed system?
5. Explain what is meant by a virtual organization and give an example on how such organizations could be implemented.
6. What is the difference between multiprocessor and multicomputer?
7. Why is it sometimes so hard to hide the occurrence and recovery from failures in a distributed system?
8. In class, I discussed why having transparency isn’t always a good thing. Do you agree with me? Explain your reasoning.
9. Scalability in distributed systems can be achieved by applying different techniques. What are these techniques?
10. When a transaction is aborted, the computing system has to be restored to its previous state as if the transaction never happened. This is actually a lie. Give an example where resetting the computing system is practically impossible.

### Deliverables
* Your writeup file *must* be done in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format and must be included in the repository as a separate file. View the file [`README.md`](README.md?plain=1) for an example of Markdown.
* Any included images or screenshots should be done in `*.jpg`, `*.png`, or `*.gif` formats, and be included individually as files in your repository (i.e. no binary ‘document’ with the images pasted inside).
* Screenshots or images *may* be linked in your Markdown file writeup if you wish to do so.
