# CECS 327 Reading Assignment: Introduction to Distributed Systems
## 10 points

### Assignment Description
Answer the following questions from the Chapter 1 reading from your textbook. Be complete with your answers. You may work on these questions with one or two other partners, but *all* students must submit the document individually in their own repositories along with each student's name documented with the submission.

1. Name two advantages and two disadvantages of distributed systems over centralized systems.
2. Describe what is meant by a scalable system.
3. Executing nested transactions requires some form of coordination. Explain what a coordinator should be doing in a scenario like this.
4. What is the role of middleware in a distributed system?
5. Explain what is meant by a virtual organization and give an example on how such organizations could be implemented.
6. What is the difference between multiprocessor and multicomputer?
7. Why is it sometimes so hard to hide the occurrence and recovery from failures in a distributed system?
8. In class, I discussed why having transparency isnâ€™t always a good thing. Do you agree with me? Explain your reasoning.
9. Scalability in distributed systems can be achieved by applying different techniques. What are these techniques?
10. When a transaction is aborted, the computing system has to be restored to its previous state as if the transaction never happened. This is actually a lie. Give an example where resetting the computing system is practically impossible.

### Deliverables
Commit the answers to the questions in a readable file to your git repository by the due date and time indicated with your repository. Approved file submission formats are: plain text (\*.txt), Markdown (\*.md), PDF (\*.pdf) or web-renderable HTML (\*.html). Github will look for one of these file formats to confirm your "submission" of the assignment. Other formats will only be accepted with *explicit* approval. **NOTE: \*.docx is *not* acceptable. I will not make exceptions for this rule being violated**.
